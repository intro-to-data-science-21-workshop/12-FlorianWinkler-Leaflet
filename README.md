# Interactive maps with leaflet

## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session on ""Interactive maps with leaflet" that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to creating interactive maps with the Leaflet package in R.

Leaflet is one of the most popular open-source JavaScript libraries for creating interactive maps. It's used by websites ranging from The New York Times and The Washington Post to GitHub and Flickr, as well as [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) specialists like OpenStreetMap and Mapbox.

Leaflet is open-source, free, easy to learn, well-documented, has a large community, and can be extended with lots of plugins. The best thing about it? You don't need to know JavaScript. The Leaflet package in R makes it very easy to create and integrate Leaflet maps in R.

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about the core features and applications on the Leaflet package, (2) show you the basic steps of creating interactive maps in R, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.
