# Interactive maps with Leaflet

## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session on the Leaflet package in R that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to creating interactive maps with the Leaflet package in R.

Leaflet is one of the most popular open-source JavaScript libraries for creating interactive maps. It's used by websites ranging from the New York Times and Washington Post to GitHub and Flickr. As aspiring data scientists, Leaflet helps you visualize and communicate your findings in interactive maps.

Leaflet is free, open-source, well-documented, easy to learn, uses a familiar R framework (e.g., the pipe operator), and can be extended with lots of plugins. The best thing about it? You don't need to know how to write JavaScript. The Leaflet package in R makes it very easy to create and integrate Leaflet maps in R.

Our presentation slides can be downloaded as a PDF file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bIQ66rcz7j0OHyNB5vWVCMIcawFmR2ky/view?usp=sharing).

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with motivation and conceptual knowledge about the core features and applications of the Leaflet package, (2) show you the basic steps of creating interactive maps in R, and (3) provide you with a live demonstration in the practice material as well as further resources.
